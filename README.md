# code-quiz

## Description

-A code quiz that tests your knowledge of web development!

- I took this project on to learn how to build a website from scratch. I wanted to learn how to implement HTML selectors in javascript, functions in javascript, and how to use local storage in the browser.  
- This site will ask the user various questions, if they get the answer wrong, the timer counts down more quickly. After the last question, the user may put in 3 initials and save that to the high score board.
- I learned many things on this project: How to use javascript HTML selectors, functions, methods, input literals, for in loops, local storage, objects, arrays, and how to create a reactive website.
